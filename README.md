## Overview

Need a high-quality screenshot to share an interesting site? This application uses the ApiFlash API to take screenshots of a given website with a variety of parameters. This lab guides you through signing up for an ApiFlash account, exploring their query builder, making static and dynamic API calls, and building a user interface to display and manage your screenshots.

---

## Goals

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Make a static API call using async/await and save the results to a state variable.
- Add and edit query parameters for API calls.

---

## Features

### Required

- Allow the user to add at least three parameters to a query to the ApiFlash API.
- Display the screenshot returned by the ApiFlash call on the page.
- On a separate part of the page, display all the images the user has queried thus far.

### Stretch

- Display whether or not your web app has hit the maximum number of queries allowed using another API call.
