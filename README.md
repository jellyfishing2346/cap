# Week 5: Lab 4 - Cap! ðŸ“¸

# Overview

Need a high-quality screenshot to share an interesting site? This application uses the ApiFlash API to take screenshots of a given website with a variety of parameters. This lab guides you through signing up for an ApiFlash account, exploring their query builder, making static and dynamic API calls, and building a user interface to display and manage your screenshots.

# Goals

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

    Make a static API call using async/await and save the results to a state variable.

    Add and edit query parameters for API calls.

# Features

# Required Features

    Allow the user to add at least three parameters to a query to the ApiFlash API.

    Display the screenshot returned by the ApiFlash call on the page.

    On a separate part of the page, display all the images the user has queried thus far.

Stretch Features

    Display whether or not your web app has hit the maximum number of queries allowed using another API call.
